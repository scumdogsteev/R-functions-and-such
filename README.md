### background

"R Functions and Such" is a collection of R scripts (functions, etc.) to be 
used in other projects.

Basically, this is for me to keep track of things I don't want to have to 
find/recreate each time I want to use them.

### scripts

* [csvCombine](https://github.com/scumdogsteev/R-functions-and-such/blob/master/csvCombine.R) - 
create a data frame from a user-specified directory's (csv) files
* [download_and_unzip](https://github.com/scumdogsteev/R-functions-and-such/blob/master/download_and_unzip.R) - 
download and/or unzip data files from the Internet
* [pkgInst](https://github.com/scumdogsteev/R-functions-and-such/blob/master/pkgInst.Rmd) - 
check whether a set of packages are loaded and/or installed and, if not, 
load/install them
* [printCurrency](https://github.com/scumdogsteev/R-functions-and-such/blob/master/printCurrency.Rmd) - 
print a number formatted as currency, including an optional multiplier (e.g., M 
for millions)
