### background

"R Functions and Such" is a collection of R scripts (functions, etc.) to be used in other projects.

Basically, this is for me to keep track of things I don't want to have to find/recreate each time I want to use them.

### scripts

* "[download_and_unzip.R](https://github.com/scumdogsteev/R-functions-and-such/blob/master/download_and_unzip.R)" - simple scripts for downloading and/or unzipping data files from the Internet
* "[pkgInst.R](https://github.com/scumdogsteev/R-functions-and-such/blob/master/pkgInst.R)" - simple script to check whether a set of packages are installed and, if not, install them
