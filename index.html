### background

"R Functions and Such" is a collection of R scripts (functions, etc.) to be 
used in other projects.

Basically, this is for me to keep track of things I don't want to have to 
find/recreate each time I want to use them.

### scripts

* [csvCombine](csvCombine/) (2015-03-02) - create a data frame from 
  a user-specified directory's (csv) files
* [download_and_unzip](download_and_unzip/) (2015-03-02) - 
  download and/or unzip data files from the Internet
* [pkgInst](pkgInst/) (2015-03-02) - check whether a set of packages
  are loaded and/or installed and, if not, load/install them
* [printCurrency](printCurrency/) (2015-05-24) - print a number 
  formatted as currency, including an optional multiplier (e.g., M for millions)
* [printMult](printMult/) (2015-06-04) - print a number with a 
  multiplier (e.g., M for millions)
