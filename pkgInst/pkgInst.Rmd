`pkgInst` is a function that checks whether a set of packages are installed and,
if not, it installs them and loads them into memory.  x is a vector of package
names.
 
This function is called as follows:
`pkgInst(c("pkg1", "pkg2", "pkg3", ..., "pkgN"))`
where pkg1 through pkgN are the names of the required packages.

```{r pkgInst, echo = TRUE}
pkgInst <- function(x) {
    for (i in x) {
        ## "require" returns TRUE invisibly if it was able to load package
        if (!require(i, character.only = TRUE)) {
            ## if package was not able to be loaded, install it
            install.packages(i, dependencies = TRUE, 
                             repos="http://cran.r-project.org/")
            ## load package after installing
            require (i, character.only = TRUE)
        }
    }
}
```

Example:
```{r example, echo = TRUE}
## start with a vector of package names, some of which have previously been
## installed and some of which (qcc in this case) have not
pkgs <- c("dplyr", "qcc", "reshape2")

## run pkgInst for this vector of packages to load them into memory and to 
## install any previously uninstalled packages
pkgInst(pkgs)
```
