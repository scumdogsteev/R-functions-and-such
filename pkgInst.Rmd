### pkgInst
##### by [Steve Myles](http://steve.mylesandmyles.info/) | 2 March 2015 (updated 18 May 2015)

"**[pkgInst](pkgInst.R)**" is a function that checks whether a set of packages are 
installed and, if not, it installs them and loads them into 
memory.  x is a set of packages.
 
This function is called as follows:
`pkgInst(c("pkg1", "pkg2", "pkg3", ..., "pkgN"))`
where pkg1 through pkgN are the names of the required packages.

This is almost completely based on [this response](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4090169/elegant-way-to-check-for-missing-packages-and-install-them/19870272#19870272).
from Stack Overflow.

```{r pkgInst}
pkgInst <- function(x) {
    for (i in x) {
        ## "require" returns TRUE invisibly if it was able to load package
        if (!require(i, character.only = TRUE)) {
            ## if package was not able to be loaded, install it
            install.packages(i, dependencies = TRUE)
            ## load package after installing
            require (i, character.only = TRUE)
        }
    }
}
```
